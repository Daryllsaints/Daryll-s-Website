  <p><h1>LAUSD: IT Trainee</h1></p>
  <p>I started out as an Intern at LAUSD, doing network monitoring, server installation, and cable pulling. It sucked.</p>
  <p>Then, I became an IT Trainee! I started learning stuff like project management, ux/ui design, technical writing, and business writing. Best move I've ever made.</p>

  <p><h1>Jukebaux: Co-Founder & CEO</h1></p>
  <p>Then, I decided to brave up. I opened a startup! We were an app-based, pre-revenue startup, focused on music.
    <p>Our mission was to decentralize radio. Unfortunately, another startup beat us to the market, so we quit. :[</p>

  <p><h1>Freelance: UX/UI Design</h1></p>
  <p>Now, I'm a freelance UX/UI designer. I haven't had any clients yet,
    <p>but I have had startups reach out to me after seeing my website, which is cool.</p>
  <h3>Coding sucks</h3>
